This is a simple WordPress Plugin wrapper for Facebookâ€™s Events API that I have worked with quite a few times now. When Facebook released a newer version of their API, I felt like it was time to make it into a plugin, to make it easier to reuse the functionality from project to project.

### Installing

1. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and enter your API information in the WP Admin.
