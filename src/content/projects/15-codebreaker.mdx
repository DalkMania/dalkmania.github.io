A simple Code-Breaking Game. Basically an automated way to create little "code-breaking" worksheets where each letter in a secret message is represented as a symbol. Kids can then refer to an alphabet lookup table, and perform the translation.

<Figure image={FirstImage} alt="Dark Mode?" caption="Dark Mode?" />
<Figure image={SecondImage} alt="Light Mode?" caption="Or maybe Light Mode?" />

This project is built using React, TypeScript, TanStack Router, TanStack DB and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a demonstration of how to use these technologies together to create an interactive web application. Also a way for me to experiment with TanStack.

<Figure image={ThirdImage} alt="Enter a Message" caption={`Enter a "secret message"`} />
<Figure

  alt="Print the Coded Message"
  caption={`Print the Coded Message and hand it to the kids to keep them busy`}
/>
