This is a simple WordPress Plugin wrapper for Greenhouse Job Board API. Which I developed for one of my clients. It's very similar to the [Lever API WordPress Plugin](/projects/lever-api-wordpress-plugin/) and the [HiringThing API WordPress Plugin](/projects/hiringthing-api-wordpress-plugin). It displays the current open positions at the company, pulling the data from the API.

### Installing

1. Upload this repo (or git clone) to your plugins folder and activate it.

### Usage

Just activate the plugin and enter your API information in the WP Admin.
