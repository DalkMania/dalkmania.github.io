SID (short for Sound Interface Device) is the name of the sound chip used in the VC 10, C64 and C128. The chip's distinctive sound is easily recognized and was clearly ahead the competition. The chip combines analogue and digital circuitry, that cannot be emulated with 100% fidelity even today. Emulated sounds do come very close to the original and a layperson is not likely to notice the difference. The SID sound is well known among retro gamers.

The design of the player was designed by: Drew Vosburg, and can be found here:
[http://codepen.io/drewvosburg/pen/YyvwJY](http://codepen.io/drewvosburg/pen/YyvwJY). The jsSID ( JavaScript SID Emulator ) used was created by: [Mihaly Horvath](http://hermit.sidrip.com).

The music in the demo is from one of my favorite C64 game series, "The Last Ninja", created by: [System 3](http://www.system3.com) back in the late 1980 - 1990s.
