A simple React HangMan game made with React and TypeScript. This was a learning exercise for me to get into and
play around with React, React Hooks and TypeScript.

  <Image
    src={FirstImage}
    alt="The Game"
    width={FirstImage.width}
    format={"webp"}
    aspectRatio={FirstImage.width / FirstImage.height}
  />

It is based on a tutorial from the [Traversy Media YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/TraversyMedia).

But I extended it a bit, by adding a [random word generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/random-words) and the [Free Dictionary API](https://dictionaryapi.dev/) for word lookups. The API enabled me to extend this relatively simple game, with other functionalty like hints and various other things.
