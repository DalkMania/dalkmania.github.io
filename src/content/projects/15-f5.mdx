At F5, I helped migrate the front-end architecture for a large-scale enterprise platform from AEM to Next.js and Sanity CMS. A major focus of the work was modernizing content management, discovery and reuse content across domains. Improving the content
editor experience and velocity in the process.

I also managed PRs, workflows, and code quality in Azure DevOps for the frontend and Sanity Studio. Built reusable React components to support rapid launches and consistent design.
